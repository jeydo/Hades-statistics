Make a quick chart of your progress in the game [Hades by SuperGiant](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/)

This project was to test a little VueJs

Inspired by this : https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/k4f6n8/it_took_me_50_tries_to_escape_for_the_first_time/

You can use it here : https://hades.jeydo.dev/

Progress is only saved in your browser but you can export and import data

Sorry for the crappy design :)
